# ML PRAGUE 2024: Using Graph Neural Networks to improve Telecommunication Networks
 
Welcome to the README for the ML Prague 2024 GNN Workshop. This document guides you through the workshop's content, including slides and practical exercises.
 
## Workshop Overview
 
Find the slides of the workshop in this repository.
 
## Exploring a graph database with Cypher in Neo4j
 
In this notebook we explore a digital Twin of telco network im a Neo4J Graph DB. Login credentials will be shared during the Workshop: [Cypher Exploration Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fuqgMQGJJ6k8Z60o1rPrjIHv-h_tvff4#scrollTo=HikgGtoyoYUN)
 
## Training a basic GNN
 
Here we practice the basics of GNNs with the Karate Club Dataset (a bit like MNIST for graphs): [Basic GNN Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pGHI2crN3nhSgOtpi1VHYX9zwxs4JHby#scrollTo=ehEmEZXmdkiH)
 
## Using an advanced GNN build for Network Optimisation
 
In this section, we deep dive into a GNN specifically built and trained for network optimization: [Network GNN Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yh6QAnX3QXLmUuH78f0xHue7nQSwtaAG)
 
Core of the notebook is the work of the Barcelone Neural Network Center specialising in Graph Neural Networks. It was part of their 2023 GNN challenge, for more info check out: [Graph Neural Networking Challenge 2023](https://bnn.upc.edu/challenge/gnnet2023/)
